CYP716A12 loss-of-function mutants do not produce hemolytic saponins and only synthetize soyasaponins, and were thus named lacking hemolytic activity (lha).  CYP716A12 catalyzes the oxidation of _-amyrin and erythrodiol at the C-28 position, yielding oleanolic acid.

The mutant does not produce normal stamens and is thus male sterile. Usually, one floret forms one caryopsis. Although mutant is male sterile, it can produce seeds when pollinated with pollen from wild type plants. In that case one or two naked seeds can be formed in a single floret. So, the mutant is female fertile. In general, a mutant floret contains many pistils but no stamens, indicating that the stamens are transformed to pistils. In some mutant florets, pistilloid stamens containing a filament tipped by malformed tissue and deformed stigma or one to three stigmas were observed. In the cross section of a wild type floret six filaments representing the six stamens and an ovary representing the pistil in the middle can be seen clearly, while in a mutant floret, some filaments and some pistilloid tissues, e.g., the ovary-like or malformed tissues are observed.

The normal AM-mediated accumulation of apocarotenoids (C13 cyclohexenone and C14 mycorradicin derivatives) was reduced in repressed plants; mycorradicin derivatives were reduced to 3% to 6% of the controls and the cyclohexenone derivatives were reduced to 30% to 47%.
