ath,AT1G02580,,AT1G02580,"In the homozygous progeny:  During early stages of embryogenesis the  development of mea-1 embryos is indistinguishable  from wild-type siblings in cleared  or sectioned specimens. Visible differences  between wild-type and mea-1 embryos  began at the late globular stage. Globular mea-1 embryos show excess  cell proliferation and enlarge radially  symmetrical. When wild-type embryos  reach the mid to late heart stage, sibling  mea-1 embryos are still globular and contain  small vacuolated cells with curvilinear cell  walls and sometimes irregular cell divisions  in the ground tissue and procambium. Suspensor  and hypophysis are normal, and cotyledons  initiate synchronously as in the  wild type. Thus, despite increased cell proliferation  and occasional irregular cytokinesis,  morphogenetic progression is normal.  However, each stage is prolonged and includes  more division cycles, and morphogenesis  is delayed. As a consequence, giant  heart stage mea-1 embryos  are present along with late torpedo or cotyledonary  stage wild-type embryos. mea-1  heart stage embryos have supernumerary  cell layers. When wild-type siblings are  fully differentiated, most mea-1 embryos  have reached the late heart stage and are up  to 10 times larger than normal. mea embryos  degenerate during desiccation. These results  suggest that mea controls cell proliferation  during embryogenesis, allowing morphogenesis  to progress normally, albeit  slowly.  Endosperm development in mea-1 seeds  is indistinguishable from that of the wild  type at early stages. When cellularization  begins normally in wild-type seeds at the  transition from the globular to the heart  stage, no cellularization is observed in sibling  mea-1 seeds. Although nuclear divisions  take place more slowly in mea-1 endosperm,  the distribution of endosperm nuclei  is as in the wild type. Partial cellularization  occurs at the micropyle when mea-1  embryos reach the late heart stage in desiccating  seeds, but because fewer nuclei have  been generated, most of the central cell is  devoid of nuclei. Thus, in mea-1 seeds, the  development of both fertilization products  is delayed but morphogenesis proceeds normally,  and it appears that the embryo shows  increased cell proliferation at the expense  of the endosperm.

Homozygous mutants had poorly developed siliques with a few or no seeds, compared with heterozygous mutant or wild type siliques that were fully filled with seeds. Flowers on the homozygous sterile plants were often slightly smaller and open for considerably longer periods than wild type, and a majority of them (80 to 90%) remained unfertilized. Otherwise, mutant plants revealed only mild very morphological and developmental phenotypes. The anthers from the sterile plants were often smaller, more heart shaped, and contained fewer pollen grains compared with wild type anthers, which were somewhat oblong and fully filled with pollen In addition, the mutant pollen grains were slightly larger than wild type. Because the mutant stamens often had shorter filaments than the wild type self-pollination was seldom efficient. However, upon manual pollination, pollen from the homozygous mutant plants germinated on self or wild type stigmas and produced fertile seeds, indicating that the mutant pollen grains, although larger, were viable. When homozygous mutant plant was pollinated with wild type pollen, the cross-pollination resulted in near normal development of siliques and production of seeds suggesting that the female development was not affected by the arp4-1 mutation. Sterility in the homozygous mutant plants is the result of production of fewer pollen and inefficient self-pollination.

Dry seeds often germinated to produce seedlings with distorted cotyledons. This defect resulted from degeneration of cotyledon tips prior to germination. Some trichomes form on cotyledons after germination and stomata are found on surface of cotyledons of mutant embryos The cotyledon surface on seedlings produced from dry seeds lacked trichomes (likely because any trichomes initiated during embryogenesis did not survive desiccation). Mutant seeds were consequently highly pigmented at maturity and anthocyanins were especially prominent in the top half of the mutant cotyledons. Mutant embryos do not form roots during the first 48 hours of culture. The pattern of storage product accumulation was altered, the hypocotyl was filled with mature protein bodies, while the cotyledons exhibited a gradient of starch and protein accumulation.

Although the ga3ox2 single mutant does not have any phenotype, plants are 30% smaller in leaf diameter and 37% shorter than ga3ox1; therefore, production of bioactive GA by GA3ox2 during early vegetative growth may be sufficient for transport to the stem to induce the partial stem elongation observed in the ga3ox1 mutant, the overall phenotype of the double mutant is consistent with expression patterns of these two genes.

Examination of cell wall patterns suggested that misoriented cell divisions were largely responsible for the irregular cell patterns. In pok1/pok2 double mutant embryos, misplaced cell walls were observed as early as the octant stage of embryogenesis. Throughout embryogenesis, the mispositioning of cell walls continues, eventually giving rise to slightly misshapen mature embryos with a stubby appearance, compared to wild-type.

Microscopic observation revealed highly disordered root meristem cell patterns, with most walls lacking parallel or perpendicular alignment to the longitudinal axis of the root and most cells exhibiting irregular shapes. Examination of cell wall patterns suggested that misoriented cell divisions were largely responsible for the irregular cell patterns. In pok1/pok2 double mutant embryos, misplaced cell walls were observed as early as the octant stage of embryogenesis. Throughout embryogenesis, the mispositioning of cell walls continues, eventually giving rise to slightly misshapen mature embryos with a stubby appearance, compared to wild-type.

ath,AT3G27060,,AT3G27060,"At the seedling stage, tso2-1 mutants were similar to the wild type, with normal roots, cotyledons, and young leaves. Abnormalities first appeared in the fifth rosette leaf and persisted in all subsequent leaves, floral  organs, and siliques. The abnormalities included white sectors in green organs, uneven thickness, rough surfaces, and irregular margins of leaves or floral organs. Stamens occasionally exhibited carpel characteristics indicating homeotic transformation. The rough and uneven sepals apparently resulted from abnormally enlarged  cells as well as cell clusters projecting above the epidermis. The white sectors appeared to result from an absence of chloroplasts in patches of mesophyll cells and the formation of large air spaces or tiny cells in subepidermal cell layers. Occasionally, tso2 mutants exhibited  fasciated stems on which a single SAM, a group of self-renewing cells at the shoot tip, was enlarged and split into multiple SAMs. Finally, tso2 mutants exhibited reduced fertility, with ;29% aborted seeds. tso2-1 floral tissues were found to contain significantly reduced levels of all four dNTPs. tso2-1 exhibited slightly  increased sensitivity to UV-C light, but only at high UV-C light levels.",,TAIR

Also, the C29 alkanes in mutants are nearly 6-fold lower, and the C30 primary alcohols are 4-fold higher compared to the wild type. In contrast to stems, the wax on mutant leaves increased roughly 43% in amount relative to the wild type, with the major increase occurring in the C31 and C33 alkanes. Approximately 70% of mutant seeds are shrunken and nonviable, with these being randomly distributed within both inflorescence and silique. Viable mutant seeds are slightly larger than those of wild type; the proportions of these fatty acids are not significantly different from wild type. Shrunken seeds contain 34% of the fatty acids of wild-type seeds, with proportionally more palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, and less of the longer and more desaturated homologs.

The pollen of the double mutant is largely defective with about 50-70% nonviability compared to ~0.5% nonviability for wild type pollen. The pollen for rhf1a rhf2a mutants appears to develop normally through PMI, but 30-40% of the pollen grain fail to undergo this mitotic division, and then, of those that did pass through, another 20-30% never go through the next round of cell division (PMII). The variety of different ploidy levels measured in generative cells arrested at the PMII phase indicate that they could be blocked at the G1, S, or G2.

Sepal fusion can occur in the absence of more than four sepals. Sepal fusion was observed most often at the base of these organs and more rarely along their entire length.

The pollen for rhf1a rhf2a mutants appears to develop normally through PMI, but 30-40% of the pollen grain fail to undergo this mitotic division, and then, of those that did pass through, another 20-30% never go through the next round of cell division (PMII). The variety of different ploidy levels measured in generative cells arrested at the PMII phase indicate that they could be blocked at the G1, S, or G2.

AT5G46700	stm-1 trn2-23010	30 from a total of 40 seedlings (75%) developed at least one leaf 8 days after germination and all double mutant progeny developed leaves by day 20. In 19 stm-1 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings, leaves initiated from the base of the cotyledons, which were always fused due to lack of early STM activity. In the remaining 21 double mutant progeny single leaves or side shoots arose laterally, from the outside of the fused base of the petioles instead of being initiated from the shoot apex and thus resembled stm-1 mutant side shoots which are initiated after a long delay.	17351828

In contrast to combination with stm-1, leaves of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutants never initiated from outside the base of the cotyledon petioles but emerged internally to the cotyledons where the SAM normally resides in wild type.

AT5G46700	trn2-2	Phenotypic differences from wild type development first became evident with the emergence of the first true leaves. All leaves were severely twisted and irregularly shaped and many lacked large parts of the leaf lamina. This twisting phenotype was not restricted to the vegetative phase but involved cauline leaves, the inflorescence stem and all floral whorls.
	17351828  
AT5G46700	trn2-2	The architecture of mutant flowers was distorted and was accompanied by reduced numbers of floral organs in the outer 3 whorls. This effect was least pronounced in the whorl of sepals (3.2 as against 4 in wild type) but the number of petals was reduced to 2.4 (4 in wild type) and on average, mutant flowers had only 3.5 stamens compared to 6 in wild type. In contrast, all mutant flowers contained 2 carpels such as in wild type but in 52% of mutant flowers, both carpels remained unfused and ovules were exposed.
	17351828  
AT5G46700	trn2-2	Unfused carpels did not form siliques later during development. In contrast, the remaining flowers with fused carpels developed siliques which were twisted and failed to fully elongate.  However, these siliques produced no fertile seeds and reciprocal crosses with wild type plants revealed nonfunctionality of both male and female reproductive organs.	17351828  
AT5G46700	trn2-23010 clv3-2	trn2-23010 clv3-2 double mutant flowers also exhibited an additive phenotype not observed in single clv3-2 or trn2-23010 plants: double mutant flowers had reduced organ numbers in sepal, petal and stamen whorls, reminiscent of trn2-23010 single mutant flowers and in contrast to clv3-2 single mutant flowers, there was no increase in the number of stamens. However, in the fourth whorl, where trn2 loss-of-function interferes with the fusion of two carpels to the single style, double mutant flowers were comprised of multiple carpels, most of them fused (73%) as typically found in the clv3-2 mutation. Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers.
	17351828  
AT5G46700	trn2-23010 wus-1	Whereas carpels were completely absent in wus-1 flowers and only 1.6 stamens (compared to 6 in wild type) developed in the third floral whorl, all trn2-23010 wus-1 flowers developed 2 carpels, which in contrast to trn2-23010 single mutants were seldom open (33%) and more usually fused. Consistent with the increased number of stamens (4.2 on average) in the third floral whorl, the trn2 mutation may compensate for a premature consumption of stem cells in wus-1 flowers. In contrast, the number of sepals and petals in the outer perianth whorls in trn2-23010 wus-1 was closer in number to that of the trn2 mutant rather than to wus-1 single mutant flowers.

Mutant plants begin flowering several days later than wild-type plants during the reproductive stages of growth. They also display more rosette leaves than wild-type plants and show reduced growth of the inflorescence stems. The height of the mature ssm plants measures approximately one-quarter of that of the wild type. In contrast to these distinct phenotypes, however, the morphology of the flower organs and the fertility levels are unaffected in ssm plants. Histological analyses revealed that the length of the epidermal cells in the inflorescence stems of ssm plants was shorter than wild type but that the ssm mutation has little or no effect on the lengths of the pith parenchyma cells. Furthermore, the length of the parenchyma cells around the midribs of the rosette leaf petioles is clearly reduced in ssm mutants, whereas the mesophyll cell size in the rosette leaf blades is unaffected.

Dark-grown seedlings subject to temperature entraining still show cycling of the CCR2:LUC+ reporter, but the period length is shorter in lip1-1 mutants than in C24 control seedlings. lip1-1 mutants do not adjust their photoperiods in response to different fluence rates of constant red or blue light, unlike wild type seedlings.

Wild type seedlings growing in dim light/dark cycles, have similar levels of morning oscillator (LHY, CCA1) genes as lip1-1, but have higher transcript levels for the TOC1 evening oscillator. Hypocotyl length is reduced in lip1-1 mutant seedlings grown under constant red or blue light at all fluences, but matches wild-type hypocotyl length for seedlings grown in constant FR light or darkness.

About 8 % of seeds contain embryos that display suspensor proliferation or polyembryony;  Some twin embryos are viable and germinate.  In addition to twinning, some embryos show variable defects in the embryo proper early in embryogenesis.  Cotyledon defects are present in about 10% of embryos/seedlings and occur independent of twinning. Defects in cotyledons/leaf organization do not extend into post-embryonic development beyond the first leaf pair. Mutant phenotype(s) appears to be embryo-specific.",,TAIR
